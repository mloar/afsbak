AFS Backup Utilities
--------------------

This is a suite of utilities designed to make backing up AFS easier.  At the
moment it really is only a single utility, tarvol, which transforms a vos dump
into POSIX tar format.  It was written by Matthew Loar <matthew@loar.name>,
based on the restorevol utility included in the OpenAFS source distribution.

BUILDING

At the moment there is no configure script, but there are few dependencies.  All
you need is:

* The OpenAFS header files.  On Debian these are included in the openafs-dev
  package.
* gcc (or another C compiler, with possible tweaking of the Makefile).
* g++ and a Standard C++ Library (this could easily go away - it just requires
  me to build a simple data structure in C instead of using std::map).

USING

A script called afsbak.sh is included.  It is designed to make using tarvol with
BackupPC simple.   To set up BackupPC to use tarvol, follow the following steps:

1. Install afsbak.sh and tarvol to /usr/local/sbin.
2. Add a host to the BackupPC hosts file.  Since BackupPC wants to ping a host
   before attempting a backup, it is often easiest to use the hostname of a
   fileserver.
3. In the configuration file for that host, add the following:
    $Conf{XferMethod} = 'tar';
    $Conf{TarShareName} = ['volume.to.back.up'];
    $Conf{TarClientCmd} = '/usr/bin/env LC_ALL=C /usr/bin/sudo /usr/local/sbin/afsbak.sh';
    $Conf{TarClientRestoreCmd} = undef;
    $Conf{TarFullArgs} = '$shareName';
    $Conf{TarIncrArgs} = '--newer=$incrDate $shareName';

This setup assumes that you want to enumerate all of the volumes to back up in
the configuration file.  For larger deployments this is probably impractical,
but devising another method is up to you.

CAVEATS

* POSIX tar format is incapable of storing files larger than 8 GB.  This
  implementation uses an extension present in GNU tar and others where base-256
  is used in such cases.
* This code uses the "ll" printf length modifier, which is new in C99 and may
  not be supported on older systems.
* The afsbak.sh script requires GNU date for incremental backup support.
