                       User-Visible afsbak Changes

afsbak 1.1 (2009-02-28)

    Remove the -omitdirs parameter to vos dump, since it only looks at mtime
    of the directory and therefore will miss updates to existing files.  Also
    stderr since BackupPC doesn't like things it doesn't recognize being
    written to stderr.

afsbak 1.0 (2009-02-12)

    Initial release.
